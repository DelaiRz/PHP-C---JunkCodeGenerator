C++ Junk-code Generator
========================

This is a C++ junkcode class generator, which will generate random classes with nonesense.
It's written in PHP, so you can host it on your webserver if you want! cheeky I know.

See example.php or example.cpp for the usage and results.


Have fun using it!
